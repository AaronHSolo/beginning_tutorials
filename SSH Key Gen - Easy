Main Reference:
https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent

1) Create your ssh key
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "bocephusdeane@gmail.com"
    You will need to add your own email

1b) Github recommends you use this, but not all platforms support this:
    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
    The -t parameter (ed25519) is a cipher. The RSA is available for all platforms. The Elliptical Diffie-Hellman curve is another type of cipher. The RSA is fine for many, ed25519 is probably even more future-proof, as far as we currently know.

ssh-keygen creates a public/private key pair.
    public key is something you can share with others to let them know it's you
    private key is something for you and you only. You can use it to log on to a system. Best Practice is to always use a password with it so that people just don't take the file and can impersonate you.

2) Go to Settings > Deploy Keys
2b) Click "Deploy key"
2c) Name it, copy the PUBLIC key text to "key", and then check the "Allow Write Access"
    I expect you to be able to make changes to this repo.
